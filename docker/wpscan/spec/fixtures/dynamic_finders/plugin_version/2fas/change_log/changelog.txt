**Important notice**

This version is a **major** version. It significantly changes the flow of authentication.

Currently, you can only authenticate through TOTP (tokens) or push (2FAS Auth mobile app). Text messages and Voice Calls are only available as a backup method.

If you are using SMS or VMS as the main authentication method, please note that the plugin will be switched to legacy mode. As soon as you configure TOTP method or disable SMS/VMS method, the legacy mode is disabled.
