-------------------------
- WordPress 4.7 Fixes

--------------------
- Transitioned to wp.media.editor.open() instead of wp.media.view.MediaFrame.open() to ensure the active TinyMCE editor

   not finish due to $el being visible before it is inserted into the DOM)
-- Removed autohide setting from Note TinyMCE theme float panel config (fixes display in browsers where toolbar would
   be hidden in some cases when it shouldn't have been)
-- Added skip focus flag to editor.focus() calls before media modals were displayed
-- Added logic to allow for some toolbars to remain visible when displaying the Note TinyMCE theme panel
-- Adjusted logic for Note TinyMCE theme panel repositioning to fallback to the editor boundaries if the current

-- Ensured the image editing toolbar was displayed if a link was selected in the editor that contained an image
