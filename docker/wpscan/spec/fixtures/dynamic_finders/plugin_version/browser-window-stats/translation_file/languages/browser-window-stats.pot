"This plugin collects data for browser width, browser height, screen width, "

"page load, and grouped into a site visit for each user. This means the "
"plugin has two modes for displaying data: visits and page views. A visit can "
"be one or many page views; they time out after 15 minutes of inactivity (no "
"more page loads)."

"The histogram shows the number of site visits or page views made within a "
"range of browser dimensions. The default range is 100px, which should pick "
"out major differences in browser window size. You can select a portion of "
"the plot area to increase the resolution and see more detail, effectively "
"reducing the range to 50px, then 20px, which should be small enough for most "
"design choices."

"Box Plot stats are provided in the legend to supplement the histogram. The "
"lower quartile cuts off the lowest 25% of the data, while the upper quartile "
"cuts off the highest 25% of the data. The Interquartile range represents the "
"middle 50% of the data, and is a good place to start when interpreting the "
"browser dimensions."
