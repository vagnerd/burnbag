== Changelog ==

= 1.40 - 2018-08-07 =
* Fixed the plugin output contents in Beaver Builder. The output code was been placed outside the defined module zone.

= 1.37 - 2018-08-07 =
* The sintax error on main.php line 390 seems to be a PHP problem afterall. Not a code bug. I successfully tested it with PHP v5.4.45, v5.5.38, v5.6.20, v7.0.3, v7.1.4 and v7.2.0. I unsuccessfully tested it with v5.2.4, v5.2.17 and v5.3.29. Furthermore, a customer reported the problem with PHP v5.6.30. Solution: update PHP to a more recent version like v7.0.3 and hopefully the problem should disapear.

= 1.36 - 2018-08-06 =
* Fixed sintax error on main.php line 390

= 1.35 - 2018-07-27 =
* Fixed permalinks not working properly.

* Fixed pretty permalinks on custom post types.

= 1.30 - 2018-07-22 =
* Added 'categories' to the 'fields' attribute. Format: categories=text;[link|nolink];[separator]. Example: "categories=text;link;, ". Default separator is " | ";
* Added three new CSS tags concerning the 'categories' field to the default and custom theme.

= 1.24 - 2018-07-22 =
* Abandoned previous version's method of using pretty permalinks based on 'Post name'. Bad idea...
* Added a new method of having pretty permalinks in ALL posts (including 'Future' posts), keeping WordPress' Permalink Settings whatever they may be. For instance: http://the-future-posts.local/my-category/sample-post/. Thanks, Joelle!
* Now all posts, incluing Future, Draft, Pending, Private, etc, will be shown to anonymous non-logged users, just like Published posts. By default, WordPress returns a 404 error page when a future post is being accessed (thus preventing a future post to be shown), unless accessed by a logged Administrator. This was happening up until now. Not anymore!

= 1.23 - 2018-07-20 =

* Added 'div' option to the 'fields' attribute. Inserts '&lt;DIV&gt' and '&lt;/DIV&gt;' HTML tag wherever needed. Format: div=[start|end];[attributes]. Example: div=start;class='my_div_class'. For the attributes, like class, use the ' apostrophe character, not the " quotation mark character.
* Fixed vertical scroll bars on CSS code frames.

= 1.11 - 2018-06-29 =
* Reorganized the plugin menu for a more intuitive interface.
* Added several illustrated demos on the 'Quick Start' menu.
