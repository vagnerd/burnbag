CHANGELOG
=========

= Version 5.1 =
* settingspage: no product section if WooCommerce plugin isn't installed and active
* file vsmd: removed unnecessary whitespaces

= Version 5.0 =
* decreased maximum meta description length from 320 to 160 characters
* why? because Google decreased this length in may 2018
* for a short period of time the maximum length was 320 characters
* this means you might have to change your meta description

= Version 4.9 =
* fix: character counter

= Version 4.8 =
* fix: mistake in plugin description

= Version 4.7 =
* some textual changes
* removed unnecessary notifications from changelog (such as "updated readme file" and "updated FAQ")

= Version 4.6 =
* fixed PHP 7.2 warning in case of an empty page excerpt (thanks Nick)

* readme file: removed donate link
* updated theme author info
* credits in changelog: removed all full names (because of the GDPR)

* best practice: removed closing PHP tag from most files
* best practice: added newline at end of most files
