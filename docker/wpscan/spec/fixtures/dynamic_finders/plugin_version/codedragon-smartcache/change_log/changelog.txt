# Changelog

## [1.1.8] - 2018-08-16
### Fixed
- Corrected the value check in the Smart_Cache_remove_update_notification() method that was preventing some 3rd-party plugins from updating properly
- Corrected the presentation order of dashboard news items

## [1.1.7] - 2018-07-27
### Fixed
- Temporary combined file cleanup routine

## [1.1.6] - 2018-07-27
### Fixed
- AJAX interface conflict
- Problem where combined files were being created for each unique site URL rather than distinct set of source files.  This generated a large set of duplicate files, one each associated with a URL.  Instead combined filenames are calculated from the hash of the filenames being combined.

## [1.1.5] - 2018-06-19
### Fixed
- Admin Javascript error that prevents automatic scanning

## [1.1.4] - 2018-06-18
### Changed
- Added a mechanism to run the site pre-scan upon activation
- Removed automatic Javascript deferment-by-attribute from core as it was causing some theme scripts to load improperly.  Deferred placement of the scripts is still performed.

## [1.1.2] - 2018-05-23
### Changed
- Updated the GZip Compression section in the smartcacheopt.conf generator to handle more mime types and increase the compression level
- Tested plugin for compatibility with Wordpress v 4.9.6
- Minor typo corrections in admin module
